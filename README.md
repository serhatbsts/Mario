## **Distributton**
1. Make sure you have JDK installed on your computer:

[Jdk Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/tr/java/technologies/downloads/)

2. Run the downloaded JDK installation file:
 
Open the JDK installation file you downloaded and double-click to launch the installer.

3. Start Setup:

Once all settings are set, click on the corresponding button to start the installation process.

4. Update the PATH Environment Variable :
   
Update the PATH environment variable to include the JDK's bin directory. This ensures that the JDK's command line tools can be called directly from anywhere. To update PATH:

**For Windows:** Add the JDK's bin directory in PATH.

**For Linux/Unix:** Add the command export ```PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.```

5. Test the Installation:
   
To test whether the JDK is installed correctly and whether the PATH and JAVA_HOME variables are set correctly, open a terminal or command client and run the ```java -version``` command. This command should display the version information of the JDK.

6. Go, copy the project to the directory of your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/serhatbsts/Mario.git
```
